To Do
=====

* Better handling of gems that depend on Rails to load.
* rake dependencies:upgrade:list - list newer gem versions available.
* rake dependencies:upgrade - upgrade installed gems that don't have a specific version in dependencies.rb
* rake dependencies:sync should ... ? call rake dependencies:upgrade by default? or just list?
